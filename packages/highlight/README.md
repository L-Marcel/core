It will still take a while for a complete documentation to come out, but I left some predefined themes and several demos in the [storybook](https://core-l-marcel.vercel.app/)!

I added the plugins field but it is disabled. I want to add support for custom languages ​​and themes, as this already exists in Prism, I will focus on making it easier to create.

I will use TypeScript to my advantage.
