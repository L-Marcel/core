# Edit __mode__
If the __editable__ property is __true__, the user will be able to enter the __edit mode__, where it is possible to change the content inside the component. 

## Tab __navigation__
In edit mode, the __tab key__ inserts a __tab space__ (as in a normal editor). To exit edit mode, just press __esc key__ or click outside the component (triggering a __blur event__).

However, if the user chooses to leave using the __esc key__, a __focus event__ will be triggered in the component, so that the component does not harm navigation by tab navigation.

When the component is __focused__, it is possible to enter __edit mode__ by pressing the __enter key__.

I thought of showing the available keys in a kind of menu, but this could harm your design and the current structure makes it __very difficult__ to do this within the component itself, so I left it free for you to choose how you want to indicate the navigation possibilities to the user.

I left two functions that can be passed for this purpose: __onEnterEditMode__ and __onExitEditMode__.
