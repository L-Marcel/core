# Prismjs
This library uses __Prism.js__ to generate the tokens for each language component, to avoid ambiguity I call these components __languages definitions__.

## Custom languages __definitions__
It is possible, but quite complex, to edit language definitions using the library. You can make your own (it inevitably requires extensive knowledge of regex, see the [demonstration](https://core-l-marcel.vercel.app/?path=/story/highlight-examples--custom-unique-language)):
<Highlight
  theme={storybookTheme}
  language="ts"
  full={true}
  style={{
    marginBottom: "1rem"
  }}
  code={languageDefinitions}
/>

The definitions are available in the __grammar__ property of the new language __instance__.

When creating a new instance it is possible to pass the raw value of this property, another instance of the class or even the name (but not an alias) of a pre-existing language (__inheriting__ the language definitions).

This is what happens in this section:
<Highlight
  theme={storybookTheme}
  language="ts"
  full={true}
  style={{
    marginBottom: "1rem"
  }}
  code={customLanguage}
/>

Within __grammar__, the mapping of __tokens__ is done, each token has one or more __rules__ within it.

These rules can have an __alias__, which is the value that can be passed after the token to be used in styling.

I left some functions available in the instance to __manipulate__ these tokens. But it is a very complex resource and I may have missed something.
<Highlight
  theme={storybookTheme}
  language="ts"
  full={true}
  style={{
    marginBottom: "1rem"
  }}
  code={tokenRule}
/>
